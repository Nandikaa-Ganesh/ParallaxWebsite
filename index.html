        <h2>Houses of Hogwarts</h2>
        <p>The Hogwarts, one of the three Wizarding schools, has four houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin. The students are sorted into one of them, based on their inner abilities and qualities, by the Sorting Hat. Each house has it's own crest, in-charge Professor,ghost, dorms, color, Quidditch team, etc. They are awarded and deprived of points based on the students performance on various grounds. The house with most points is awarded The House Cup at the end of each year. Now let us see briefly about each house...</p>

        <h2>Gryffindor</h2>
        <p>With Lion as it's crest, the house values bravery, chivalry, courage and nerve. The colors are scarlet and gold. The house was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Most of the main characters of the plot come from this house - starting from Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore. The head of the house during Potter years was Porfessor McGonagall. The Gryffindor Tower is the dormitory of the Gryffindors. It has one of the best Quidditch players. It is not to be forgotten that the Marauders were also Gryffindors. The ghost of the house is Nearly Headless Nicholas 'Nick'. My personal favourite Gryffindors are Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom. Other notable Gryffindors are Harry Potter (how could we forget him), the Weasleys, Hagrid, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. It is to be noted that the house always had arch rivalry with Slytherin House. <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gryffindor" target="_blank">To know more..</a></p>

        <h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
        <p>The emblem of Ravenclaw is the Eagle. It values intelligence, creativity and wit. The colors of the house are blue and bronze. The house was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, whose daughter Helena is the ghost of the house.The Ravenclaw Tower in the west side of Hogwarts is the dormitory of the house. The head of the house during Potter years was Professor Flitwick. The anchoring vital characters of the plot come from this house like Luna Lovegood (my personal favourite), Professor Trelawney. Some of the important Ravenclaws are Ollivander, Cho Chang, Professor Lockhart, Professor Quirrell.The Ravenclaws are actually more academically motivated, hard-working, talented students. Hermione was almost placed in this house when finally she was sorted into Gryffindor. <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ravenclaw" target="_blank" >To know more..</a></p>

        <h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
        <p>Symbolising fairness, hard-working and patience, the house has Badger as it's house crest. The colors are yellow and black. The house was founded by Helga Hufflepuff. Fat Friar is the house ghost. The dormitory is somewhere near the kitchens. The students of Hufflepuff have strict moral code for themselves. One of the most important Hufflepuff and mostly the favourite one of every Potterhead (my personal favourite) is Cedric Diggory. He is the straight depiction of the house - he stood for justice, he supported Harry throughout the Triwizard Tournament rightly, even when he had a chance to take the cup. The head of the Hufflepuff during Potter years was Professor Sprout. They are the least rival with other houses eventhough they temporarily had a little spat with Gryffindor during the Triwizard Tournament. <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hufflepuff" target="_blank">To know more..</a></p>

        <h2>Slytherin</h2>
        <p>"Not all Slytherins are evil" - will be the best opening line for the house. This house has Serpent as it's emblem. The house colors are emerald green and silver. The house was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Most of the Slytherins are parseltongues - they have the ability to talk to serpents, which is apparently dark magic. Bloody Baron is the house ghost. The house was headed by Professor Snape and Professor Slughorn during Potter years. It produced most of the Dark Wizards - Lord Voldemort, the Malfoys, Bellatrix Lestrange, Umbridge. Albeit not all were purely evil. Draco and Narcissa had showed their humanity before the war which played an important role in the plot. The dormitory of the house is in the Dungeons. <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Slytherin" target="_blank">To know more..</a></p>
